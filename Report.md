### 1.1 Introduction to transformers

Transformer models, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), constitute a breakthrough in sequence modeling. First, they were proposed for machine translation, but Transformers have become the standarts in natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, computer vision and time series analysis.

Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), Transformers do not process sequences sequentially. They rely on a self-attention mechanism that allows each element of a sequence to directly attend to all other elements in parallel. This design enables more efficient training, better handling of long-range dependencies.
